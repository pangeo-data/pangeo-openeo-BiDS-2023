# Part-2: OpenEO (Comment: Intro Session)

This Part is going to introduce participants to openEO Platform. Attendees will learn what openEO Platform is, how to find data and run first process graphs. 
We will also show attendees how to integrate custom code into your workflow using User Defined Functions.

## 11:00 Getting started with OpenEO (15 minutes) 
Benjamin (EODC)

- Intro Presentation and Questionnaire on who is the audience


## 11:15 Finding Data, Running first graphs, difference to client-side processing

Daniel (Sinergise)
- Logging in People and showing them around
- Showing Different Clients (R, Python & Web editor)
- Show viewing functionality in webeditor  

-> switch to python client here

Valentina/Sean (EODC)

- Notebook showing how to search data & find metadata
- Aggregate temporal period, Corine Landcover - Change detection , Tone Mapping
- Local/ Client Side Processing: â†’ Align with Michele on this what to show - replicate a small UC that we are presenting anyways


## 11:45 Integrate custom code into your workflow using User Defined Functions 
Jeroen (VITO)
 
- Take over logged-in people showing them workflow creation and custom code introduction into their workflow 
- complex workflows with predefined functions (worldwater, rank composites)
- FAIR metadata generation
- Short note on costs: https://docs.openeo.cloud/federation/accounting.html#platform-credit-rates
- Storing results and loading them again with load_stac

This will be in part 3:
- complex workflows with UDF, machine learning or what FuseTS does with running Python libraries such as Whittaker algorithm 


## 12:15 Feedback Block
