## Case 1 Rank composites 

Scientifically correct compositing is the foundation of many EO processing workflows.
This case shows a max-NDVI composite, which is also a template for more advanced composites.

## Case 2 Machine learning training and inference

Timeseries based classification of pixels to assign categorical labels is another base-technique in the EO 
toolbox. This example uses Random Forest, which is superseded by more advanced AI models, but is still 
regarded by many as a baseline against which more complex approaches can be compared.

Operational products, like [Copernicus landcover 3.0](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc) are
also based on random forest.

## Case 3 ESA WorldWater

ESA WorldWater is an example of rule based classification, using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1, it was developed
by DHI-GRAS.

A similar water detection example is the AquaMonitor, developed by Deltares:

## Accounting in openEO platform

When running openEO scripts on small scale locally, you use your own resources. When running at larger
scale in the cloud, this generates a small cost per run. 

While these costs are often relatively small compared to the time savings, it is important to keep track of.
Here we explain how to do exactly that.
